# Overview

The goal of this assignment is to train a machine learning algorithm to identify
the quality of a specific exercise routine, namely, bicep curls using dumbbells.
In the provided data, participants of a study were trained to perform bicep
curls correctly as well as incorrectly, emulating four common mistakes.
Each of these five "types" of bicep curls have been given their own category
labeled "A" through "E". Throughout each session, the motion of each participant
was measured using accelerometers worn on the arms and waist. The trained
machine learning algorithm should be able to correctly distiguish between each
category of bicep curls using the measurements from the accelerometer.
